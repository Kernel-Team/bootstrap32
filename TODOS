- how to clean up sysroot nicely without having to rebuild the cross-compiler?
  for now only removing and stowing a copy somewhere before building stage1
  helps.
- pacman with a '--no-execute-hooks' option
- makepkg with an 'alternate root' option (which doens't collide with
  pacman's options), avoids patching -r and --config into makepkg for
  stage1
- shims and provides and depends don't work yet:
  - binutils and glibc-shim
  - same for gcc-libs: glibc and gcc-libs for gcc
- bsdtar: /home/cross/i486-root/packages/i486/linux-docs-4.15.1-2-i486.pkg.tar.xz: Not found in archive
  bsdtar: /home/cross/i486-root/packages/i486/linux-headers-4.15.1-2-i486.pkg.tar.xz: Not found in archive
  bsdtar: Error exit delayed from previous errors.
  Built package linux.
- gcc PKGBUILD instead of diff
- removing all pacman databases and recreating them with repo-add, also
  removing all installed pacman packages seem a little bit paranoic. Find
  out how to speed this up and do it properly.
- as soon as asp32 creates a combined PKGBUILD when exporting a package,
  we can remove the git repo packages32 and the cat of the diff-PKGBUILD
  in build_stage1_package.sh
- when uninstalling pacman in the chroot, you must rename pacman.pacsave
  back to pacman.conf as it is used for building packages
- pacman has some issues with the sync databases (pacman -Syyu results
  in):
  debug: returning error 6 from _alpm_db_register_sync : wrong or NULL argument passed
  error: could not register 'temp' database (wrong or NULL argument passed)
  error: no usable package repositories configured.
  installing and listing packages by hand works without problems.
  debug: unregistering database 'local'
- pacman problem: ca-certificates-utils-shim-20170307-1-any definityely contains
  the /etc/ssl/certs/ and the ca-certificates.crt, but it doens't get installed?!
- make: recursive tarkets like all-recursive don't work, neither with cross-compiled
  make nor with the recompiled make on the stage1 system. No clue why?!
