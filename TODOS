- how to clean up sysroot nicely without having to rebuild the cross-compiler?
  for now only removing and stowing a copy somewhere before building stage1
  helps.
- pacman with a '--no-execute-hooks' option
- makepkg with an 'alternate root' option (which doens't collide with
  pacman's options), avoids patching -r and --config into makepkg for
  stage1
